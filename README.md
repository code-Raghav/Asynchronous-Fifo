# Asynchronous FIFO Module

## Overview

This module contains an implementation of an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer in Verilog. The FIFO buffer is essential in digital systems where data needs to be transferred asynchronously between two different clock domains. This module supports configurable data and address widths and handles synchronization between read and write operations across distinct clock domains.

## Features

- **Data Width (DSIZE)**: Parameterizable width of the data being stored (default: 8 bits).
- **Address Width (ASIZE)**: Parameterizable width for address lines, which determines the FIFO depth (default: 4 bits, giving a depth of 16).
- **Write and Read Operations**: Independent clocks for write and read operations.
- **Full and Empty Flags**: Output flags to indicate whether the FIFO is full or empty.
- **Gray Code Pointers**: Uses Gray code to prevent glitches during pointer updates.

## Components

### 1. **Inputs and Outputs**

- **Inputs:**
  - `w_enable`: Write enable signal.
  - `w_clk`: Write clock signal.
  - `w_rst`: Write reset signal (active low).
  - `r_enable`: Read enable signal.
  - `r_clk`: Read clock signal.
  - `r_rst`: Read reset signal (active low).
  - `w_data`: Data to be written into the FIFO.

- **Outputs:**
  - `r_data`: Data read from the FIFO.
  - `full`: FIFO full flag.
  - `empty`: FIFO empty flag.

### 2. **Internal Signals**

- **Pointers:**
  - `wptr`, `rptr`: Gray code pointers for write and read operations.
  - `w_bin`, `r_bin`: Binary pointers for write and read operations.

- **Synchronization Signals:**
  - `rptr_sync2`, `rptr_sync2`: Write domain synchronized read pointers.
  - `wptr_sync2`, `wptr_sync1`: Read domain synchronized write pointers.

- **Flags:**
  - `wfull_val`, `rempty_val`: Internal signals to compute FIFO full and empty statuses.

### 3. **FIFO Memory**

- A memory array with a depth of \(2^{ASIZE}\) and width equal to `DSIZE`.

## How It Works

1. **Pointer Synchronization:**
   - Read and write pointers are synchronized across clock domains using dual flip-flop synchronizers to avoid metastability.

2. **Pointer Generation:**
   - **Binary to Gray Code Conversion**: Write and read binary pointers are converted to Gray code to minimize errors when crossing clock domains.

3. **Flag Management:**
   - **Full Flag (`full`)**: Generated when the FIFO is at maximum capacity, based on the write pointer and read pointer values.
   - **Empty Flag (`empty`)**: Generated when the FIFO is empty, based on the read pointer and the synchronized write pointer values.

4. **Memory Operations:**
   - Data is written into the FIFO memory on the rising edge of the write clock if the FIFO is not full.
   - Data is read from the FIFO memory on the rising edge of the read clock if the FIFO is not empty.

## Example Usage with a test bench

To integrate this FIFO into a project, instantiate the module with appropriate parameters for data width and address width. Connect the module to your designâ€™s read and write interfaces, ensuring proper clock and reset signals.

```verilog
async_fifo #(
    .DSIZE(8),
    .ASIZE(4)
) my_fifo (
    .w_enable(write_enable),
    .w_clk(write_clock),
    .w_rst(write_reset),
    .r_enable(read_enable),
    .r_clk(read_clock),
    .r_rst(read_reset),
    .w_data(write_data),
    .r_data(read_data),
    .full(fifo_full),
    .empty(fifo_empty)
);
```
### Simulation Results

The following describes the simulation procedure and the corresponding observations for the asynchronous FIFO module:

#### 1. **Initial State Without Initialization**
   - At the start of the simulation, no initialization has been applied to the FIFO. The `w_clk`, `r_clk`, `w_enable`, `r_enable`, `w_rst`, and `r_rst` inputs are 'unknown' or 'x'.

#### 2. **Forcing Clocks and Inputs**
   - The `w_clk` is set to 100 MHz, and the `r_clk` is set to 75 MHz to simulate different clock domains.
   - All control inputs (`w_enable`, `r_enable`, `w_rst`, and `r_rst`) are set to '0' during this phase. The FIFO remains in an idle state, with no data being written or read.

#### 3. **Disabling Reset**
   - The reset signals `w_rst` and `r_rst` are set to 1 to turn off the active-low resets, enabling normal operation of the FIFO. The internal pointers are reset, and the FIFO is now ready for data transactions. At this point, the `empty` flag is high, indicating that the FIFO is empty, while the `full` flag remains low.

#### 4. **Writing Data into FIFO**
   - The `w_enable` signal is asserted (set to 1) to allow data to be written into the FIFO.
   - Four distinct data values (`56`, `45`, `23`, and `5`) are sequentially written into the FIFO with each rising edge of the `w_clk`. The `empty` flag goes low as data fills the FIFO, and after writing all four values, the FIFO remains not full (`full = 0`).

#### 5. **Reading Data Until FIFO is Empty**
   - The `r_enable` signal is asserted (set to 1) to start reading data from the FIFO.
   - Data is read sequentially on the rising edge of the `r_clk`. Each read operation decrements the FIFO's depth. After all data has been read, the `empty` flag is asserted, indicating that the FIFO is empty and no further data can be read until more is written.
